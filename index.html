            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
            	Everything began in January, when we had our first course of Introduction to Entrepreneurship. We have discover our team members. We were more or less strangers to each other. At the beginning it was pretty difficult to find an interesting idea about Health, which is a very big subject. After several meetings, we finally decided to create Food Hero, a very simple app who can litterally change your life with simple recipes.

            <h2>Our concept</h2>
         <p>
            Now, we are proud to introduce our newest app named Food Hero, it is basically the saviour of your kitchen and time! Our app allows you to learn new fun cooking recipes, share your experience with others, and interact with them through challenges. You can also get a <strong>premium subscriber option</strong> and access to top chef's recipes that will bring new flavours to your cuisine. We aim to make people feel closer to each other and make cooking more of an enjoyable experience rather than a chore. We want you to see that <strong>happiness can be found in the smallest of everyday things we do</strong>; all you need is open your heart to them. Happiness begins in the tummy! And our app is just the perfect place for that happiness to start. As mentioned before, we want to create an interactive platform for our audience by introducing live streaming, photo and video sharing, and messaging capability. The essential core functions of Food Hero are to share tips and recipes, serve as a culinary dictionary, a grocery list and increase interaction with food lovers.
